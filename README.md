# F1_data

This data was produced the Kaggle Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020.

The objective of this project was to present some of the best runners of all times, and highlight the achievements of Lewis Hamilton.

By the end, some models were trained trying to create a greate predictor for the World Championship 2022, but as things have changed (Mercedes lost its domincance, and RedBull started its kingdom) 
all models lacked did not performed well to these changes.
